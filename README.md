# UAT-GPE338
The Advanced Gameplay Programming concepts in Unity 3D from [University of Advancing Technology](http://www.uat.edu/).

Each week, new concepts were introduced that required drafting of "teachback" lessons to demonstrate comprehension of
 that week's material.

At the end of the course, there was a rubric of items that needed to be implemented in a game project.

For the first week, I wrote a simple Unity project that wasn't really a game.

I was planning on writing a small "Stock Trading" game for the course final - but then I decided to refactor a previous
 course project: [UAT Tanks (UAT-GAM205)](https://github.com/Mordil/UAT-GAM205).
